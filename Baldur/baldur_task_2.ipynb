    "\n",
    "The goal of this report is to analyse customer review data to better understand the regional market so that the business is more likely to achieve success for the opening of their restaurant in Philadelphia. In particular, we aim to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An insight on what restaurant consumers generally seem to like (for example in terms of food, service, location, etc…).\n",
    "2. An analysis of the evolution of food trends in the area over time, in terms of consumer preferences. Do the preferences evolve over time, or do they seem stable?\n",
    "3. Imagine you have to present your findings to the business owner and his investors. What advice would you give to the new business, based on your findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of the task, we'll focus on customer reviews which concern restaurants located in the city of Philadelphia. First, let's take a look at the data to see how we can approach this task."

    "Before starting the analysis, we'll have to obtain the relevant review data. Let's start by importing the data and then inspecting their structures. It is worth mentioning that the reviews in the test data (`ATML2024_reviews_test.csv`) are NOT used in this analysis, since they don't contain the ratings by customers for the businesses which will hinder our ability to know the preferences of restaurants in Philadelphia."

    "### Glimpsing at the data\n",
    "Below cells show the data types of the columns as well as the first 5 rows of each dataset. Based on the output, in order to extract reviews about restaurants in Philadelphia, we can first filter out businesses who are based in Philadelphia under the `city` column, and then look at those whose categories include restaurants. One crucial thing to note that, however, is that due to the textual nature of the data, there's no guarantee that the `city` column is free of typos or has standardised how Philadelphia is referred to. For example, the city is sometimes referred to as Philly. We shall inspect this column more in detail to ensure that we include all the restaurant reviews in Philadelphia (or at least we don't miss out too much because of typos).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also notice that some columns aren't in the correct data types and will need to be changed if they're to be used in the following analysis. For instance, the date-related columns (`date` in `reviews_df` and `user_since` in `users_df`) are wrongly marked as `object`, and the `premium_account` column is just a string of years concatenated together which might pose some troubles if we'd like to look like the number of premium users by year. But for now let's focus on filtering restaurant reviews in Philadelphia."

We said that we had a huge, dying/dead palm tree and needed it removed. Clyde and Sons Tree Service was working at a neighbor's house, so we saw that they were legitimate. They came back to our house the next week with their equipment and performed the job at the time and price we negotiated. He climbed up the tree and did an excellent, careful job and removed the 4500 lb.tree which was quite close to our house. They also ground up the tree stump, which was double in size, because half of the tree was already cut down in years past, and the old stump was left next to the present tree. We felt his price was very reasonable for the extent of the job.  I would not hesitate to call Clyde and Sons Tree Service for removal of any tree and stump. Very competent, hardworking gentlemen.

The pizzas were HUGE and cooked to perfection. Best New York style pizza I've had in a long time. The mild and parmesan garlic wings were fantastic, lightly crisp with the right amount of sauce. My only disappointment was that I thought for sure we would have a ton of left overs but it was so delicious we ate almost everything. I can't wait for my next order!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2020-01-29 00:20:34 |\n"
