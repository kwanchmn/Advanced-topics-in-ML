    "\n",
    "The goal of this report is to analyse customer review data to better understand the regional market so that the business is more likely to achieve success for the opening of their restaurant in Philadelphia. In particular, we aim to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An insight on what restaurant consumers generally seem to like (for example in terms of food, service, location, etc…).\n",
    "2. An analysis of the evolution of food trends in the area over time, in terms of consumer preferences. Do the preferences evolve over time, or do they seem stable?\n",
    "3. Imagine you have to present your findings to the business owner and his investors. What advice would you give to the new business, based on your findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of the task, we'll focus on customer reviews which concern restaurants located in the city of Philadelphia. First, let's take a look at the data to see how we can approach this task."

    "Before starting the analysis, we'll have to obtain the relevant review data. Let's start by importing the data and then inspecting their structures. It is worth mentioning that the reviews in the test data (`ATML2024_reviews_test.csv`) are NOT used in this analysis, since they don't contain the ratings by customers for the businesses which will hinder our ability to know the preferences of restaurants in Philadelphia."

    "### Glimpsing at the data\n",
    "Below cells show the data types of the columns as well as the first 5 rows of each dataset. Based on the output, in order to extract reviews about restaurants in Philadelphia, we can first filter out businesses who are based in Philadelphia under the `city` column, and then look at those whose categories include restaurants. One crucial thing to note that, however, is that due to the textual nature of the data, there's no guarantee that the `city` column is free of typos or has standardised how Philadelphia is referred to. For example, the city is sometimes referred to as Philly. We shall inspect this column more in detail to ensure that we include all the restaurant reviews in Philadelphia (or at least we don't miss out too much because of typos).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also notice that some columns aren't in the correct data types and will need to be changed if they're to be used in the following analysis. For instance, the date-related columns (`date` in `reviews_df` and `user_since` in `users_df`) are wrongly marked as `object`, and the `premium_account` column is just a string of years concatenated together which might pose some troubles if we'd like to look like the number of premium users by year. But for now let's focus on filtering restaurant reviews in Philadelphia."

We said that we had a huge, dying/dead palm tree and needed it removed. Clyde and Sons Tree Service was working at a neighbor's house, so we saw that they were legitimate. They came back to our house the next week with their equipment and performed the job at the time and price we negotiated. He climbed up the tree and did an excellent, careful job and removed the 4500 lb.tree which was quite close to our house. They also ground up the tree stump, which was double in size, because half of the tree was already cut down in years past, and the old stump was left next to the present tree. We felt his price was very reasonable for the extent of the job.  I would not hesitate to call Clyde and Sons Tree Service for removal of any tree and stump. Very competent, hardworking gentlemen.

The pizzas were HUGE and cooked to perfection. Best New York style pizza I've had in a long time. The mild and parmesan garlic wings were fantastic, lightly crisp with the right amount of sauce. My only disappointment was that I thought for sure we would have a ton of left overs but it was so delicious we ate almost everything. I can't wait for my next order!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2020-01-29 00:20:34 |\n"

The data type of the `date` column is defined as `object` which will hinder our ability to analyse changes in customer preferences over time later, so let's convert it into `datetime` type object. By looking at the first few rows of the data, we also notice that the `attributes` column is in json format. It will be good to convert them into something easier to use for subsequent analysis if needed, namely by removing the symbols specific to json format with regex.\n",

    "Missing values are also present in some columns of our data, and this is relatively the most serious for `hours`. Given the primary task is to make sense of customer preferences for restaurants in Philadelphia, opening hours are likely to be less informative than food style and service for deciding the optimal business strategy to open a new restaurant in the city. Accordingly, we will simply drop the `hours` column first, and then check how many rows will be omitted if we only include rows which contain non-null values in all the other columns."

    "It will also be useful to look at how the average ratings evolved throughout this period, and more importantly how many reviews (or observations) there are for each month in the dataset, since this will affect how certain we can say about the food preference of customers in a given month. \n",

    "In the line plot on the left below, the monthly average rating throughout the period fluctuated around 3.7, albeit there was some erratic movement up to the end of 2007. What could be the reasons? The line plot on the right showing the number of reviews per month might give us an answer, namely, there were very few (sometimes even only a single digit) reviews for each month until December 2007, and thus the variances of the average rating for these months will be higher than subsequent months starting from 2008 when there were substantively more observations. We shall bear this characteristic in mind as we analyse the evolution of food trends in later sections, and we will discuss how to handle this accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting observations from the right line plot is that the number of reviews had a sharp drop since February 2020. Given how countries (including the US) responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by lockdowns (one of the measures being the prohibition of dine-in in restaurants), it is then not surprising that customers had fewer (or even no) chances to visit restaurants and thus not able to give as many reviews as before the COVID outbreak.

    "Besides looking at what customers in general like about restaurants, it will be also beneficial to understand whether food preferences by customers might change over time. For instance, there might exist \"seasonality\" for certain types of cuisine, as fondue 🫕 is usually more preferred by customers in winters than in summers. Having knowledge of food trends in Philadelphia can be useful for the business owner to decide which type of restaurant to open and whether he will have to adjust the restaurant's capacity for service depending on the season. \n",
    "\n",
    "But how should we define \"food trends\" with the data we are using? Recall that the `categories` column, now that only restaurant-type businesses are included, contain information about the types of catering services or cuisine a restaurant offers. Accordingly, we will see how the average ratings for categories of restaurants changed over the period of time covered in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing from where we left off about the number of reviews for each month in the dataset, we will only analyse the food trends with data from 2008 because the earlier period in the dataset contains too few observations in each month for us to make any reliable conclusions about the food trends. But first, let's put our attention to how we can summarise the categories of the restaurants."

Using the categories directly will then make presenting the food trends in a concise manner to the business owner difficult."

    "We would therefore need a way to summarise all the restaurants in Philadelphia as a few major types and then look at how the ratings have evolved for them over the period covered in the dataset. Using Cluster analysis, which is one of the unsupervised learning algorithms, to find similar groups (the number being pre-defined) in the data will be very helpful for this task. The first step is then to convert the restaurants, whose categories are in texts in the dataset, into some representations that can be understood by unsupervised learning algorithms which use numerical inputs. Word embeddings can help with this. \n",
    "\n",

    "1. Train word embeddings for the categories of restaurant-related businesses\n",

    "For word embeddings, we will opt for the Word2Vec algorithm and train it on the restaurant categories in the dataset. A brief explanation of the above decision: we are training a Word2Vec model here because our task is quite specific, namely, understanding the food preferences of customers in Philadelphia on several major types of restaurants. If we use pre-trained embedding models, then we will likely risk not being able to understand how some categories with other usages in English just mean for restaurant categories. For instance, \"Chinese\" is one category of restaurants included in the dataset, but it can also be used in other contexts such as politics and media, and it is very likely that pre-trained models (usually on a large corpus of documents from the Internet) will not have embeddings for the word \"Chinese\" solely on its meaning as a cuisine style.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for using the Word2Vec algorithm, one of the reasons is that it can be easily trained with personal computers via `gensim`, unlike GloVe which requires using the command line to train or Transformers architectures which are prohibitively expensive for individuals to train on their own computers. Moreover, Word2Vec can capture more nuances of the restaurant categories beyond their similarities than rudimentary embedding methods like the bag of words or TF-IDF. \n",
